## üìù **Common Interview Questions & Quick Answers**

### **Q: "Explain your project architecture"**
**A**: "I built a production-ready static website using Terraform and AWS. The architecture includes S3 for hosting, CloudFront for global CDN, WAF for security, DynamoDB for data storage, and VPC for network isolation. It follows AWS Well-Architected Framework principles."

### **Q: "Why these AWS services?"**
**A**: "S3 is perfect for static websites - no server management. CloudFront provides global performance and DDoS protection. DynamoDB is serverless and auto-scales for contact forms. WAF protects against attacks. VPC provides network security."

### **Q: "How do you handle security?"**
**A**: "Multiple security layers: WAF with rate limiting, CloudFront SSL enforcement, S3 bucket policies, DynamoDB encryption, and VPC network isolation. This defense-in-depth approach ensures protection even if one layer fails."

### **Q: "Cost optimization strategies?"**
**A**: "I use AWS free tier extensively, implement S3 lifecycle policies, CloudFront caching to reduce costs, and created scripts to easily shutdown infrastructure when not needed. The main cost is NAT Gateway at ~$45/month."

### **Q: "How do you deploy and manage?"**
**A**: "Terraform handles infrastructure deployment with modules for organization. I use scripts for easy restart/shutdown. Website updates go through S3 sync and CloudFront invalidation. Everything is version-controlled and documented."

## üîç **Troubleshooting Quick Reference**

### **Website Not Loading**
1. Check CloudFront distribution status
2. Verify S3 bucket policy allows CloudFront access
3. Check WAF rules aren't blocking traffic
4. Validate SSL certificate

### **Performance Issues**
1. Check CloudFront cache hit ratio
2. Analyze S3 response times
3. Review DynamoDB throttling metrics
4. Monitor WAF blocking rates

### **Deployment Issues**
1. Verify Terraform state consistency
2. Check AWS provider version compatibility
3. Validate variable values
4. Review resource dependencies
