## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture & Design Questions**

### **Q2: "Walk me through your project architecture"**

**Perfect Answer:**
"I designed a multi-tier, secure architecture for a full-stack serverless website:

1. **Frontend Layer**: CloudFront CDN provides global content delivery with SSL termination
2. **API Layer**: API Gateway handles RESTful API requests with CORS and rate limiting
3. **Compute Layer**: Lambda functions process contact form submissions serverlessly
4. **Security Layer**: WAF protects against attacks with rate limiting (2000 requests per IP)
5. **Storage Layer**: S3 hosts static files with versioning and encryption
6. **Data Layer**: DynamoDB stores contact form data with encryption
7. **Network Layer**: VPC with public/private subnets for security isolation

The flow is: User ‚Üí CloudFront ‚Üí WAF ‚Üí S3 (static files) + API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí DynamoDB (dynamic data). This architecture follows AWS Well-Architected Framework principles."

**Visual Aid**: Draw this on a whiteboard:
```
User ‚Üí CloudFront ‚Üí WAF ‚Üí S3 (Static Files)
                ‚Üì
            API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí DynamoDB
```

### **Q3: "Why did you choose these specific AWS services?"**

**Perfect Answer:**
"Each service serves a specific purpose:

- **S3**: Perfect for static websites - no server management, automatic scaling, cost-effective storage
- **CloudFront**: Global CDN provides low latency worldwide, handles traffic spikes, includes DDoS protection
- **API Gateway**: Manages RESTful APIs with built-in CORS, rate limiting, and Lambda integration
- **Lambda**: Serverless compute for contact form processing - no server management, auto-scaling, pay-per-use
- **DynamoDB**: Serverless NoSQL database ideal for contact form data, auto-scales, encryption at rest
- **WAF**: Essential security layer protecting against OWASP Top 10, rate limiting, and bot protection

## üîß **Terraform Technical Questions**

### **Q5: "Explain your Terraform module structure"**

**Perfect Answer:**
"I organized the code into logical modules for reusability and maintainability:

```
modules/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vpc/          # Network infrastructure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ s3/           # Storage and website hosting
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cloudfront/   # CDN distribution
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apigateway/   # API management and routing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lambda/       # Serverless compute functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dynamodb/     # Database tables
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ waf/          # Security layer
```

**Benefits of this structure:**
- **Reusability**: Each module can be used in different projects
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one service don't affect others
- **Testing**: Each module can be tested independently
- **Team Collaboration**: Different team members can work on different modules

**Module Communication**: Modules expose outputs that other modules consume, creating clean interfaces between components."

### **Q6: "How do you handle secrets and sensitive data in Terraform?"**

**Perfect Answer:**
"For this project, I used several approaches:

1. **Variables File**: Non-sensitive config in `terraform.tfvars`
2. **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data via `TF_VAR_` prefix
3. **AWS Secrets Manager**: For production secrets (not implemented in this demo)
4. **IAM Roles**: Service-to-service authentication without hardcoded credentials

**Example:**
```bash
export TF_VAR_db_password="secure-password"
terraform apply
```

**For Production**: I'd use AWS Secrets Manager with Terraform data sources to fetch secrets dynamically, ensuring they're never stored in code or state files."

### **Q7: "Explain Terraform state management"**

**Perfect Answer:**
"Terraform state is crucial for tracking resource status and managing dependencies:

**Local State (Current Project):**
- `terraform.tfstate` file stores resource mapping
- Tracks current vs desired state
- Manages dependencies between resources

**Production Best Practices:**
1. **Remote State**: Use S3 backend with DynamoDB locking
2. **State Encryption**: Enable server-side encryption
3. **Access Control**: Restrict state file access
4. **State Backup**: Enable versioning on S3 bucket

**Example Remote State:**
```terraform
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state"
    key    = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-west-2"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}
```

This prevents state corruption and enables team collaboration."

## üîí **Security Questions**

### **Q8: "How do you ensure security in your infrastructure?"**

**Perfect Answer:**
"I implement defense-in-depth security across multiple layers:

**Network Security:**
- VPC with public/private subnet separation
- Security groups (though not explicitly defined in this project)
- NAT Gateway for private subnet internet access

**Application Security:**
- WAF with rate limiting (2000 req/IP/5min)
- CloudFront SSL enforcement
- S3 bucket policies restricting access to CloudFront only

**Data Security:**
- S3 server-side encryption (AES-256)
- DynamoDB encryption at rest and in transit
- Point-in-time recovery for data backup

**Access Security:**
- IAM roles with least privilege principle
- No hardcoded credentials in code
- CloudTrail for audit logging (recommended addition)

**Security Monitoring:**
- CloudWatch metrics for WAF and CloudFront
- Alarms for unusual traffic patterns

This multi-layered approach ensures that if one security control fails, others provide protection."

### **Q9: "What security vulnerabilities should I be aware of?"**

**Perfect Answer:**
"Several security considerations for this architecture:

**Current Protections:**
- WAF rate limiting prevents DDoS
- S3 bucket policies prevent direct access
- HTTPS enforcement via CloudFront

**Potential Vulnerabilities & Mitigations:**
1. **S3 Bucket Exposure**: Ensure bucket policies are restrictive
2. **DynamoDB Access**: Use IAM roles, not access keys
3. **WAF Bypass**: Monitor for unusual traffic patterns
4. **Data Exfiltration**: Implement VPC Flow Logs
5. **Misconfigurations**: Use AWS Config for compliance checking

**Additional Security Measures I'd Add:**
- AWS Shield for DDoS protection
